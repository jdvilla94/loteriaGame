# loteriaGame
This a loteria game, or the hispanic version of bingo. I have a menu screen, and enter username screen. After you input the data, it randomizes a 4x4 card for you. It then 
randomizes and picks a card of 54 until the deck runs out. If the randomized card of 54 is in your own 4x4 card then it automatically adds a bean to the card for you. Purpose
of the game is to win 4 across, 4 diagnolly, or 4 vertically. Once you win it asks if you would like to play again or exit. The game has audio files i recorded that says the card.
The game is entirely built in python and pygame. I succesly connected it to a sever and client, but i couldnt pass all the data properly. I will add pvp option later when I study and get 
more familiar with sockets.
